	<p> Hi, I'm Hannah. If you're wondering where I'm from, let me refer you to a project I did for your web class last year.
<a href= "http://creative.colorado.edu/~havi0491/web/responsivestory.html">click!</a>
This isn't interesting but I'm super hungry right now. </p>
	<p> My experience with web technologies is limited (web) but I am both crazy interested and super scared to get more into it this semester. </p>
	<p> In this class I'd like to really get responsive design down because I struggled with that a lot. Also I'd love get beginning full stack skills down because I want a job :$) </p>
